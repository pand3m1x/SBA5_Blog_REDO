A brief description of your project.

  This is a cute blog, based on the manga series Nana, with the 
  character Hachi in mind, as she writes out her thoughts. Hence
  the pink and strawberries. And further planned features. 


Instructions on how to run the application (if anything beyond 
opening index.html in a browser is needed).

A reflection on your development process, challenges faced, and 
how you overcame them.
  I still struggle with knowing when to put things into
  the correct things, and it often seems to be the thing
  that keeps my code running the first time. Especially because
  they all wouldn't make errors in my console. One time I just
  forgot to save an refresh. Lots of google-ing, reading 
  other peoples blog codes on stackoverflow forum. And Youtube


Any known issues or features not implemented.

  Yes, blog doesn't automatically empty when an item posts,
  will need to add that into the addPost function. I do 
  believe I got the minimum requirements, and would simply like
  to add and play with different features to personalize the
  project. Or adding a date stamp, or making sure the posts
  populate from last to recent, instead of recent to last.
